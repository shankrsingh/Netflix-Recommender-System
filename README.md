## Built a Movie Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering
**Dataset consists of Ratings given by a user to movies**
I used various techniques to infer the similarity between users and movies
 - We built user-user similarity matrix
 - We built movie-movie similarity matrix
 - We extracted various features from these matrices to build Machine Learning Models
 - We build on Knn,gbdts,suprise-baseline,suprise-knn
 - Best Model is combination of collaborative features and features gathered by training the surprise models
